# Genesis host guard — refuse Bash commands that reach for the operator's
# secrets. Wired to PreToolUse, which can block a call by exiting 2.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT: containment. A determined route-finder gets around any
# per-command check, and this project's own security chapter says so plainly —
# deny `gh api` and the agent reaches the same API with `curl`. Treat this as a
# tripwire for the *accidental* case, which is the case that actually happened:
# an agent hunting for the definition of a shell alias ran
#
#   grep -rn "gci" ~/.zshrc ~/.dotfiles.local/*.sh ~/.dotfiles/**/*.zsh
#
# and that glob covers a file holding work credentials. Nothing was exfiltrated,
# nothing was even looked for, and the matched lines would still have landed in a
# transcript and a log sink. A guard that costs one process spawn and stops the
# careless case earns its place; a guard sold as a boundary does not.
#
# THE REAL FIX is not on this machine. Under GitHub Actions the agent runs in an
# ephemeral runner with no home directory worth reading. Under `genesis serve` it
# runs as you, with your entire home directory in reach, and no hook changes that.
# If you need containment rather than a speed bump, run the loop somewhere that
# isn't your laptop.
#
# Fails OPEN: a bug here must not wedge the loop. That is a deliberate trade and
# the reason this is a tripwire rather than a wall.

# A heredoc body that is being written as TEXT is prose, and prose that merely
# names a credential path is not a read of one. Refusing it is a false positive,
# and this guard's own documentation is the most common victim: any doc, pull
# request body or escalation that says what the guard blocks has to name the
# paths it blocks.
#
# The discriminator is NOT "is it a heredoc." It is *what consumes the body*. A
# body going to a file is text; a body going to `bash` is a program, and
# exempting heredocs wholesale would hand back a trivial evasion:
#
#     bash <<'EOF'
#     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
#     EOF
#
# So this exempts a body only when its opener is a single, simple command whose
# name is a known text sink. Everything else keeps its body in scope. The two
# ways to be wrong here do not cost the same: a missing entry in the sink list is
# another false positive, while a missing entry in a list of interpreters is a
# hole. So this allowlists the safe shape rather than denylisting the unsafe one,
# and anything it cannot confidently classify stays in scope.

# nearest of these finds the command that actually OWNS the heredoc, which is not
# the same as the first word of the line. The common shape for writing a pull
# request body is
#
#     gh pr create --body "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"
#
# where the line starts with `gh` but the body is consumed by `cat` inside a
# substitution. Taking the first word would classify that as `gh`, and treating
# the `$(` as disqualifying would refuse the single most common way an agent
# writes prose about this guard.
